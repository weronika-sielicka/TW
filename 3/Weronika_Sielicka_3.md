# What is rubber duck debuging?

It's a popular technique programmers use to find mistakes in their code, in other words, debug it.
In rubber duck debugging, you go over your code line-by-line and describe it as if you were explaining it to someone with no programming knowledge, like a rubber duck.
As you carefully read and explain the code, you can find errors, such as a typo, or incorrect logic.
